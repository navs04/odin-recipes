    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kimchi fried rice (Kimchi Bokkeumbap) is a bold, flavorful <em>Korean</em> dish that turns simple ingredients into a delicious, spicy, and umami-packed meal. Made with <strong>fermented kimchi</strong>, rice, and a few pantry staples, this dish is a go-to for quick, satisfying comfort food. The magic lies in the tangy, slightly sour depth of kimchi, which caramelizes beautifully when stir-fried, blending perfectly with the rice. A drizzle of sesame oil adds richness, while green onions and sesame seeds enhance the aroma. Topped with a fried egg, the creamy yolk balances the spiciness, creating an irresistible harmony of textures and flavors. Whether you're using <strong>day-old</strong> rice or fresh-cooked grains, this one-pan meal is easy, quick, and perfect for a busy day!</p>

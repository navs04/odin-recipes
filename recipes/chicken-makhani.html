    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Makhani, popularly known as <strong>Butter Chicken</strong>, is one of the most beloved dishes in <em>Indian</em> cuisine. This rich and creamy dish features tender, marinated chicken cooked in a luscious tomato-based gravy infused with aromatic spices, butter, and cream. The magic of Butter Chicken lies in its perfect balance of tangy tomatoes, earthy spices, and the silky texture of butter and cream, creating a melt-in-your-mouth experience. Traditionally, the chicken is first marinated in yogurt and spices, then grilled or pan-seared for a smoky depth before being simmered in a luxurious sauce. Served with naan, roti, or steamed rice, this dish is a comforting and indulgent treat that never fails to impress.</p>
